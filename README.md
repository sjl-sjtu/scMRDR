We implement a scalable and flexible generative framework called single-cell Multi-omics Regularized Disentangled Representations (scMRDR) for unpaired multi-omics integration. The manuscript has been accepted as a **spotlight** paper on The Thirty-ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025).
